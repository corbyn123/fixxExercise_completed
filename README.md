## Fiix Android Exercise

Welcome to the Fiix Android exercise, This repo contains all the required information for the base project setup along with
any sample data. 
The project is defaulted to Kotlin and you can find all corresponding
files within the `kotlinsample` package. If you are more comfortable with Java you can find all
the files under the `javasample` package.

The aim of this exercise is for you to show us how you would best implement a solution. 

### Problem:
1. Given a list of trivia questions, display them in a list.
2. The user should only be able to see the questions in this list.
3. Each question should have a `ANSWER` button
4. When the user clicks on the `ANSWER` button, the list item should be updated to show the answer and hide the `ANSWER` button.
5. When the user clicks on any item, they should be shown a details screen that shows
the question, the answer and a save button. Both the question and answer can be edited.
4. Upon navigating back to the list, if the user has updated the question or answer reset that specific item to only display the question and `ANSWER` button again until the answer is revelead.

### Additional Details:

- A class called DataProcessor is how you will access the answers. 
- You are free to modify any part of the code except for code that is marked with a comment that says `//DO NOT MODIFY`

When you are done please create a pull request.
